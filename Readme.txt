Brief, On this planet, we have a few characters... politicians, oligarchs, corporations, institutions... who only have the goal of getting more power. Leaving along the way destroyed families and misery.

This project is not a social critique. Specifically, we are calling for the simplification of commercial agreements that are strangling the conciliation between the different countries.
