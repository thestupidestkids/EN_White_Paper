# Executive summary

### I**ntroduction**

#### _The Stupidest Kids a NFT critic collectible with a mini game where we provide an enviroment to our community to protest about actual politics_

_Nuestra vision es crear una nueva forma de hacer critica en el universo crypto aprobechando el alcance mediatico que tienen los NFTs. Ningun integrante del equipo (meses atras) se habia imaginado que la tension politica llegaria al punto que ha llegado. Dado que la situacion es critica, estamos dando lo mejor de nosotros para ofrecer un proyecto que ridiculice a los politicos actuales, ya que consideramos que se estan portando como crios._

_Creando un entorno en el que la gente de a pie pueda alzar la voz para reclamar los derechos basicos universales alli donde esten (llendo al trabajo en metro, en el autobus, en casa despues de un dia duro de trabajo...). Siendo asi una comunidad despierta y con un proposito._

_// No es facil compaginar el dia a dia con tratar de dejar un mundo mejor, por este motivo el proyecto contara con un minijuego sencillo y divertido que trata de ridiculizar a los altos cargos._

Such an ambitious goal requires relentless focus in the following areas:

* Collectible : max supply of 200 for each president. There will be from start to finish only 10 presidents. No more in the future in the whole game.&#x20;
* Discord : Events and governance.
* Telegram : Community discussion.
* Medium, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, Facebook : To reach the audience & Info News.
* We plan to have a PVP, strategy, a dynamic trading market, and social influence.
* There will be a sustainable economy where players can play and earn tokens.&#x20;
*   Community governance future, the value is in our community.&#x20;

    1 ) We will involve our people in the decision making between the different paths TSK may take.

    2 ) Rewards : NFT airdrops, TSK airdrops, Sticker NFT airdrops, $ airdrops.
* The Stupidest Kids will be available on polygon chain making it accessible to everyone. Which has a very low fee layer two technology.





The Stupidest Kids will initially be available as a NFT collectible with a click to earn. Followed by a mini game in the browser.

They can use game internal points to mint NFTs thta can be traded for real money. Players will be able to buy a maximun of 2 NFTs of each president and expresion.

Guild of Guardians is partnered with Guardians Guild Limited, issuing and distributing an in-game currency that will be used in the Guild of Guardians mobile game. The in-game currency, named Gems, is an ERC-20 token that is being created, issued and distributed by Guardians Guild Limited. Players can earn Gems for free by playing the game, and must spend Gems whenever they want to mint a new asset to the blockchain, make a primary or secondary sale purchase, or vote on important game decisions.&#x20;

One of the unique aspects of the Guild of Guardians Gem economy is the ‘rewards pool’. Any Gem used in the game (e.g. to craft items to summon heroes) will be sent to this ‘rewards pool’. In addition, 20% of all primary sales, as well as 20% of secondary trading fees to Guild of Guardians, must be paid for in Gems. Gems used in this way are transferred to a rewards pool and distributed proportionately to all Gem holders who actively stake Gems. Gems will also be used for governance and voting.&#x20;

Guild of Guardians is developed by Stepico Games and published by Immutable. Stepico are a mobile games development studio who have released multiple titles with 5m+ downloads, while Immutable are one of the largest VC-funded blockchain start-ups and the team behind Gods Unchained and Immutable X. We currently have a team of over 20 full-time staff dedicated to making Guild of Guardians successful, and have plans to grow this number in the next year.&#x20;

Since starting development in mid 2020, Guild of Guardians has attracted a passionate community of over 220,000 followers across Email, Twitter and Discord. We have successfully sold out our first NFT Founder sale which generated $4.6 million that will be used to grow the game. We have also developed partnerships with leading brands such as Ubisoft, Sandbox and Yield Guild, all of whom are dedicated to the long-term success of Guild of Guardians.

The entire Guild of Guardians team is super excited by the early success we have had so far, and we look forward to disrupting the gaming industry and bringing NFT games to a mainstream audience.&#x20;
