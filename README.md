# Executive summary

### I**ntroduction**

#### _Guild Of Guardians is a multiplayer, fantasy, action RPG where players build their dream team of Guardians and compete in a guild to earn epic rewards._&#x20;

Our vision is to build the world’s most popular RPG where millions of players can turn their passion for gaming into real assets. We are on a journey to disrupt the gaming industry and to build the future of play-and-earn - a world where gamers can play a game they enjoy, while simultaneously earning and trading as part of a massive, open-world economy.

Such an ambitious goal requires relentless focus, and we plan to spearhead the future of NFT gaming by demonstrating excellence in the following areas:

* Fun mobile RPG gameplay: Guild of Guardians will be fun and compelling. We plan to have a combination of action RPG, deep strategy, a dynamic trading economy metagame, and social focused gameplay that will keep players engaged for years.
* Play-and-earn mechanics: There will be a deep and sustainable economy within Guild of Guardians where players can play for free and earn both NFTs and tokens. Just like the real world economy, you can choose how you want to specialise or play within the Guild of Guardians Economy.&#x20;
* Community driven incentives: We understand the value that a community brings to the game. Guild of Guardians will involve and reward the community for contributing to the growth of the overall ecosystem, and empower creators to build long-term businesses in the Guild of Guardians metaverse.&#x20;
* Highly accessible: Guild of Guardians will be available on iOS and Android, making it hyper accessible to everyone. The underlying technology will be based on Immutable X, allowing players to enjoy instant and gas-free trading, eventually without even knowing they are using the blockchain.&#x20;

Guild of Guardians will initially be available on iOS and Android and will be released in 2022. In this game, players will take their team of heroes through challenging dungeons to collect resources and earn experience. They can use these resources to craft items or summon heroes which can be traded for real money. Players will be able to build their dream team and will work with their Guild to earn leaderboard and seasonal prizes.

Guild of Guardians is partnered with Guardians Guild Limited, issuing and distributing an in-game currency that will be used in the Guild of Guardians mobile game. The in-game currency, named Gems, is an ERC-20 token that is being created, issued and distributed by Guardians Guild Limited. Players can earn Gems for free by playing the game, and must spend Gems whenever they want to mint a new asset to the blockchain, make a primary or secondary sale purchase, or vote on important game decisions.&#x20;

One of the unique aspects of the Guild of Guardians Gem economy is the ‘rewards pool’. Any Gem used in the game (e.g. to craft items to summon heroes) will be sent to this ‘rewards pool’. In addition, 20% of all primary sales, as well as 20% of secondary trading fees to Guild of Guardians, must be paid for in Gems. Gems used in this way are transferred to a rewards pool and distributed proportionately to all Gem holders who actively stake Gems. Gems will also be used for governance and voting.&#x20;

Guild of Guardians is developed by Stepico Games and published by Immutable. Stepico are a mobile games development studio who have released multiple titles with 5m+ downloads, while Immutable are one of the largest VC-funded blockchain start-ups and the team behind Gods Unchained and Immutable X. We currently have a team of over 20 full-time staff dedicated to making Guild of Guardians successful, and have plans to grow this number in the next year.&#x20;

Since starting development in mid 2020, Guild of Guardians has attracted a passionate community of over 220,000 followers across Email, Twitter and Discord. We have successfully sold out our first NFT Founder sale which generated $4.6 million that will be used to grow the game. We have also developed partnerships with leading brands such as Ubisoft, Sandbox and Yield Guild, all of whom are dedicated to the long-term success of Guild of Guardians.

The entire Guild of Guardians team is super excited by the early success we have had so far, and we look forward to disrupting the gaming industry and bringing NFT games to a mainstream audience.&#x20;
