# Executive summary

### I**ntroduction**

#### _The Stupidest Kids is a NFT critic collectible with a mini game where we provide an enviroment to our community to protest about actual politics_

Our vision is to create a new form of criticism in the cryptocurrency universe by leveraging the media reach that NFTs have. No member of the team (months ago) had imagined that the political tension would reach the point it has reached.&#x20;

As the situation is critical, we are doing our best to offer a project that ridicules the current politicians, as we believe they are behaving like children.

It is not easy to combine the day routine with trying to create a better world

Creating an environment in which folks can raise their voices to claim basic universal rights wherever they are (going to work in the subway, on the bus, at home after a hard day's work...).&#x20;

For this reason the project will have a simple and fun mini-game that tries to ridicule the high officials.

Being an awakened and purposeful community.

Such an ambitious goal requires relentless focus in the following areas:

* Collectible : max supply of 200 for each president. There will be from start to finish only 10 presidents. No more in the future in the whole game.&#x20;
* Discord : Events and governance.
* Telegram : Community discussion.
* Medium, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, Facebook : To reach the audience & Info News.
* We plan to have a PVP, strategy, a dynamic trading market, and social influence.
* There will be a sustainable economy where players can play and earn tokens.&#x20;
*   Community governance future, the value is in our community.&#x20;

    1 ) We will involve our people in the decision making between the different paths TSK may take.

    2 ) Rewards : NFT airdrops, TSK airdrops, Sticker NFT airdrops, $ airdrops.
* The Stupidest Kids will be available on polygon chain making it accessible to everyone. Which has a very low fee layer two technology.

The entire team is excited, and we look forward for NFT's disruptive force that can reach the mainstream with the goal of being listened by our politicians.
