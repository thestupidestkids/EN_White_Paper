### PLAYERS

**After NFTs presale** there will be only **800 players**

On April 7, users will be able to mint 1 P. NFT of each type every 6 hours (for all users)

**Between May and June** all NFTs will be sold and we'll reach teh **maximun of 2000 players**

(There won't be any possiblity to mint more P. NFTs, never)

### MINTING

PRESALE

* Mid March first 80 P. NFTs of first 4 presidents (320 players)
* Mid March first 80 P. NFTs of last 6 presidents (480 players)

AFTER PRESALE

(As we mention, with P. NFT minting)

U. NFTs also will be minted 40 of each type every 6 hours (for all users). We have calculate a difference between offer and demand of 15%-30% (to increase the demand)

### REWARDS

ROI variable (Between 30 - 40 days)

We have developed an algorithm to mantein reward's pool with the following atributes

* Pool will never be under 10% of his capacity
* We have some variables to calculate rewards&#x20;
  * Predictable variables (NÂº of players, reward reserve)
  * Changing variables (Market and token fee back to pool)
* Is not depending on token's price&#x20;
* We will calculate rewards daily depending on circular economy
* We will provide reward reserve at least for 3 months in a fix way and another 3 months on variable way

### STAKING

We also have an staking pool.&#x20;

* We'll provide also a fix staking plan for 2 months.&#x20;
* After, staking will continue with the 2% income from TSK token&#x20;

### MARKET TAXES

For NFT buyers in the market place (or opensea or similar) there will be a tax 4% in Matic and 4% in TSK (% depends on the price seller's given). This tax will go to TSK liquidity pool.

(NFT minting is tax free)
